GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs in **<PODNAME>** and discussing features, bugs and general feedback. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/<PODNAME>), [FAQ](https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<PODNAME>/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<PODNAME>/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
