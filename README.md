**DATAStack** helps you to alleviate the Core Data boilerplate. Now you can go to your AppDelegate remove all the Core Data related code and replace it with [an instance of DATAStack](https://github.com/3lvis/DATAStack/blob/master/Demo/Demo/AppDelegate/ANDYAppDelegate.m#L19).

## Initialization

You can easily initialize a new instance of **DATAStack** with just your Core Data Model name (xcdatamodel).

``` objc
self.dataStack = [[DATAStack alloc] initWithModelName:@"MyAppModel"];
```

## Set up

Is recommendable that **DATAStack** gets persisted when this three methods get called in your `AppDelegate`.

``` objc
- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
    [self.dataStack persistWithCompletion:nil];
}

- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application
{
    [self.dataStack persistWithCompletion:nil];
}

- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application
{
    [self.dataStack persistWithCompletion:nil];
}
```

## Main Thread NSManagedObjectContext

Getting access to the NSManagedObjectContext attached to the main thread is as simple as using the `mainContext` property.

``` objc
self.dataStack.mainContext
```

## Background Thread NSManagedObjectContext

You can easily create a new background NSManagedObjectContext for data processing. This block is completely asynchronous and will be run on a background thread.

``` objc
- (void)createTask
{
    [self.dataStack performInNewBackgroundContext:^(NSManagedObjectContext *backgroundContext) {
        Task *task = [Task insertInManagedObjectContext:backgroundContext];
        task.title = @"Hello!";
        task.date = [NSDate date];

        [backgroundContext save:nil];
    }];
}
```

## Clean up

Deleting the `.sqlite` file and resetting the state of your **DATAStack** is as simple as just calling `drop`.

```objc
[self.dataStack drop];
```

## Testing

**DATAStack** is optimized for unit testing and it runs synchronously in testing enviroments. Hopefully you'll have to use less XCTestExpectations now.

You can create a stack that uses in memory store like this if your Core Data model is located in your app bundle:

```objc
self.dataStack = [[DATAStack alloc] initWithModelName:@"MyAppModel"
                                    bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]
                                    storeType:DATAStackInMemoryStoreType];
```

If your Core Data model is located in your test bundle:

```objc
self.dataStack = [[DATAStack alloc] initWithModelName:@"MyAppModel"
                                    bundle:[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]]
                                    storeType:DATAStackInMemoryStoreType];
```

_(Hint: Maybe you haven't found the best way to use NSFetchedResultsController, well [here it is](https://github.com/3lvis/DATASource).)_

## Installation

**DATAStack** is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'DATAStack'
```
